    "On the other hand, if most of the data you work with are not in these formats and your workflow is primarily in Python, GeoPandas may be the tool for you. For example, for a geoscientist (earth, environmental, climate sciences) who works most often with large multi-dimensional data arrays (time,level,lat,lon) in formats like .nc, .tif, .grib, .hdf, .csv, Python will be a much more efficient and reproducible tool for scientific analysis. For this use case, packages like GeoPandas make working with the occasional shapefile or geodatabase very easy within your existing Python workflow instead of having to use a separate GIS tool for part of your analysis.\n",

    "# V. Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)\n",
    "\n",
    "A CRS is a framework used to locate and map geographic features on the Earth's surface. The key components of a CRS are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coordinate System:** Defines the grid used to specify locations on the Earth, including the axes (like latitude/longitude or X/Y) and distance units of measurement (degrees or meters, for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datum:** The modeled version of the shape of the earth (usually represented by an ellipsoid). The datum also defines the origin (or reference point) of the coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Projection:** A mathematical transformation that translates the spherical coordinates on the Earth's surface onto a flat surface like a map. No projection is perfect. Each will have different distortions which can affect area, shape, distance, and/or direction. Different projections are used based on the area of interest and the purpose of the map. Some coordinate reference systems do not have a projection, meaning their coordinate system and datum define locations on a 3-dimensional Earth rather than a 2-dimensional map. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, there are actually two types of CRS's: geographic coordinate reference systems and projected coordinate reference systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geographic coordinate reference systems** are used to locate places on a 3-dimensional Earth surface based on two values, longitude and latitude, usually with units of decimal degrees. Units of angular distances are not linear due to the polar convergence of longitudes and the slight bulge of the earth at the equator. Therefore, a geographic CRS is not suitable to calculate or compare distances between locations. A common geographic CRS would be EPSG:4326, which uses a latitude and longitude coordinate system and the WGS84 (an ellipsoid) datum to represent locations on the whole Earth. Confusingly, sometimes this CRS is referred to as the WGS84 CRS. I like to use the EPSG codes when discussing CRS's because they are unique identifiers that can eliminate a lot of confusion. EPSG:4326 is the default CRS used in many GPS systems and is also used by Google Earth.\n",
    "- **Projected coordinate reference systems** are based on a Cartesian coordinate system on a flat surface. Map projections are used to convert the 3D surface of the Earth into x and y coordinates of the projected CRS. A common projected CRS that you may encounter is EPSG:3857, also known as the Web Mercator projection. This CRS is used for many web mapping applications include Google Maps and Apple Map.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your choice of CRS will depend on how big your area of interest is, the region of the globe where it is located, and what you want to calculate. Projections that preserve shape are called conformal; those that preserve area are called equal-area; those that preserve distance are called equidistant; and those that preserve direction are called azimuthal. These words might assist you in finding a projected CRS that preserves that geospatial properties most important to your analysis. Also, keep in mind that you can \"reproject\" from one CRS to another to increase the accuracy of calculations that require preservation of different geospatial properties (e.g. area vs distance) .\n",
