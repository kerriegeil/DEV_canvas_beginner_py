    "# II. Introduction to the Xarray Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray builds upon many other Python packages, including Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, netCDF4, Matplotlib and more. The Xarray package is most convenient when working with multi-dimensional data stored in netcdf data files. Xarray can also handle zarr, tiff, csv, hdf, and grib files but may require additional dependencies to be installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the [Xarray documentation](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable): \"Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates, and attributes on top of raw Numpy-like multidimensional arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover what all that means shortly! Another gigantic benefit of Xarray is that it integrates well with the Dask package for parallel and distributed computing, which enables fast computation on large data. This aspect of Xarray is a bit too advanced for this course, but it's worth mentioning here, regardless. \n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray is under active community development and pushes new updates approximately monthly. This means that developers are actively working on improvements and expanded capabilities and that there will probably be useful updates more frequently than you may be used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures - DataArray and Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray's core data structures are called the *DataArray* and the *Dataset*. A DataArray is an N-dimensional array of a single data variable with *labels* (metadata) that describe the array *dimensions*, *coordinates*, and *attributes* of the data. A Dataset contains one or more DataArrays which share one or more dimensions and coordinates. We will cover what all this Xarray terminology means below, but you can also find more detail in the [Xarray User Guide Terminology page](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/terminology.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an Xarray Dataset object and walk through all its components. We'll load data from the file ```data/nclimgrid/nclimgrid_tmax_199401-202312.nc```. This netcdf file contains the monthly averages of daily maximum surface air temperature (tmax) for 30 years on a spatial grid. The original source of this data is [NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00332) but the file we are working with has been subset in time and clipped to the state of Mississippi.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the function ```xr.open_dataset()``` to easily load data from the netcdf file into an Xarray Dataset object. As you can see below, when we print the Dataset object ```ds``` to the screen, we get a ton of information. This information is what we meant above by the terms \"metadata\" or \"labels\"."

    "Click on the paper icon to the right of the DataArray ```tmax``` and you will see even more metadata labels. These are called *variable attributes*. Variable attributes are contained in a Python dictionary where the dictionary keys are the attribute names (\"units\", \"standard_name\", etc.) and the dictionary values are the attribute values (e.g., \"degree_Celsius\",\"air_temperature\"). If we were writing our own data to a netcdf file, we could include any variable attributes we want to help describe the data. But generally, when you are working with climate data, the convention is to use the Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions."

The data file we are working with uses the CF Conventions and that is why the ```tmax``` variable attributes have those specific names (e.g., \"standard_name\")- they come from the list of attributes in the [CF Metadata Conventions Appendix A: Attributes](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#attribute-appendix).  \n",

    "Now, the data file itself may also have attributes called *file attributes* or *global attributes* that are separate from variable attributes. We can find these attributes in the print out above under the \"Attributes\" section. This particular file doesn't have any file attributes as indicated by the zero next to the Attributes section. You can imagine, though, that if you were to write your own netcdf file of data, you may want to include file attributes like \"institution\" or \"Conventions\" (these examples come from Appendix A of the CF Conventions linked above) to indicate inside your data file what institution created that file and what version of the CF Conventions was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other information we can see about the ```tmax``` DataArray includes the data type (float32) and the dimension names and order (time,lat,lon). Unlike NumPy arrays, where axis 0, axis 1, axis 2, etc can represent anything, there is no ambiguity about what each dimension represents with Xarray data structures because they are labeled. If we look toward the top of the print out we can see each dimension length. The ```tmax``` DataArray, which is stored inside the ```ds``` Dataset, contains temperature data for 360 times at 116 latitudes and 85 longitudes.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of our three dimensions is associated with a *coordinate variable*. Coordinate variables (or simply \"coordinates\") enable us to include very useful metadata about the dimensions of our DataArrays. Click the data stack icon next to any of the coordinates in the print out above and you will see the time, latitude, and longitude arrays of values that are associated with each dimension of the DataArray ```tmax```. For example, we can see that our ```tmax``` data begins in January 1994 and ends in December 2023. Click the paper icon next to the time coordinate and you will see that each coordinate variable also has its own attributes! This is because coordinates are DataArray structures. Coordinate variables hold the dimension values and dimension attributes. Coordinates are super important as they allow us to select data using labels instead of index positions as we will see shortly.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's pull the ```tmax``` DataArray out of the Dataset into a new variable in our notebook called ```tx```. We can access the variables in a dataset using a dot and the variable name."

Climate data variables and their coordinates from a netcdf file are usually interpreted as a NumPy numeric or datetime data type when they are read from a file into NumPy arrays (within the DataArray structure). Labels and attributes from a file are read into strings, tuples of strings, and dictionaries of strings as we've already seen.\n",

Using the data stack icon, you can see that each coordinate is also an array of values, similar to an index in Pandas.
