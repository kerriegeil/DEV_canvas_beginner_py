# DEV_canvas_beginner_py

Welcome! The intent of this course is to provide beginner-level Python students with the tools and resources they need to start writing useful code for their own scientific data analyses. The course covers the basics of the Python programming language, a few common Python packages that are useful for scientific analysis (Pandas, GeoPandas, Numpy, Xarray), input/output of different data types, data cleaning, and data visualization. Examples and exercises in the course center mostly around weather, climate, and environmental data analysis. Students will follow along with the course videos, interactively executing and writing code in their own Jupyter notebooks.

**The course is taught at the *Python* beginner level, but not at a *computer programming* beginner level.** Therefore, suggested prerequisites include 1-2 semesters of (or equivalent practical experience): 
- computer programming fundamentals,
- programmatic data analysis

**Who Should Register?**

Individuals who:
- already have some exposure to programming and data analysis,
- are interested in learning Python but who may or may not have any Python experience,
- plan to use Python for scientific data analysis,
- want to use Python to analyze weather, climate, environmental, or similar geospatial data.
