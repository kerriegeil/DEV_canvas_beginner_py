    "Pandas is a powerful tool for working with tabular data such as data stored in spreadsheets, databases, or other table-like formats. The main data structure Pandas used to hold data is called the *DataFrame*. A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional (rows and columns) structure that can store data of different types including strings, integers, floating point values, categorical data and more. DataFrames are like a spreadsheet - think of a table of data with headings and values. Each column of a Pandas DataFrame is its own data structure called a *Series*. Both data structures (DataFrame and Series) have an *index*. You can think of an index, for now, as a row or line number, but it can be anything, even text.\n",

Often there is more information (metadata) that is required by future users of the data than just the column names and data values. Metadata for the collegefootballbowl.csv can be found in the [collegefootballbowl.txt](data/collegefootballbowl.txt) file, which tells future data users the original source of the data, when the data file was created, and contains a data dictionary that describes each column of data. This type of information is super important especially when your data values have units. Even future you may forget if your data is in Celsius or Fahrenheit, or if your precipitation data had units of cm, mm, inches, or hundredths of inches! "

If all values in a column appear to be integers, Pandas will infer that the column is data type int. Sometimes, there can be mistakes in your data file though. You could have a data column, for example winner_rank, that should contain all integers or missing values but a data entry mistake in your file has added 1 or more values that are non-numeric in that column. A lot of real data is \"messy\" like this. In these cases where there are mixed data types in a single column, Pandas usually reads the whole column as strings and assigns a data type of \"object\". This is in fact the case with our data columns winner_rank and loser_rank, which we will investigate a bit more later.\n",
