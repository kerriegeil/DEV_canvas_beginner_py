This is highly unusual, as using Python almost always requires importing packages. We'll import packages in all other course notebooks and cover how to do it in subsequent notebooks."

Python doesn't use curly brackets like C-like languages do, but uses indentation to mark out blocks of code. Jupyter will take care of this for you for the most part, automatically indenting when you type Enter after a colon. If you are using a plain text editor though, just be consistent, you have to use tab or a consistent number of spaces for the indent, but you can't mix styles or you will get errors."
