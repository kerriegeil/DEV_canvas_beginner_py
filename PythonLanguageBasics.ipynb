    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "In Python, everything is an *object*, including variables and functions (which we'll get to shortly). In the previous section we stored the phrase \"Hello World\" in a variable named `myMessage`. A variable is an object (like a little container) that holds data. Variables have names and they can contain data of many different types (numbers, text strings, etc). Variables are created with an assignment statement (identifiable by the = operator) as we saw above with ```myMessage```. When you create a variable, your computer allocates a place in memory, names that place whatever you've named your variable, and saves the value of your variable in that place. \n",

    "byte array ```bytearray``` | varName = bytearray(5) | binary\n",
    "NoneType ```None``` | varName = None | a special object that indicates the absence of a value\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using strings, integers, floats, and boolean data in this course, which you may already be familiar with if you've programmed before:\n",
